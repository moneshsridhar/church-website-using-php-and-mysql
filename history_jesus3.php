<center><h2> THE HISTORY AND SPIRITUALITY OF INFANT JESUS OF PRAGUE</h2></center><br><br>
<h3 style="color: black; font-weight: bold;">MIRACULOUS</h3>
<p style="color: black;">&nbsp &nbspRecords of miraculous phenomenon in conection with the sculpture of the Infant Jesus did not end sometime in the past. They occur even today.</p>
<p style="color: black;">&nbsp &nbspOne happened to a two year old Tamara in Brazil. From birth she had disconnected hips and could only walk with difficulty with the help of a special equipment, which, by the way is kept in our church of Infant Jesus of Prague. She could hardly walk. The parents prayed a novena to the Infant Jesus of Prague and on the 6th day, she could take the first steps without the equipment that aided her. The doctors were astonished. The friends could not believe it. The whole family arrived in 1995 in this church, to thank the Miraculous Infant Jesus of Prague.</p>
<p style="color: black;">&nbsp &nbspAnother case is the healing of an Indian woman, who had an accident in her youth, that paralyzed her. For a long time she had to rest in bed without moving. Once in a dream she saw the Infant Jesus and she understood, that she can be healed. She prayed the novena to the Infant Jesus, that someone ordered for her. While praying she started to observe that gradually the feeling come back to her feet and to her whole body. After a few weeks she was healed. In about 1994 she arrived here from USA as a 70-year-old grandmother with her husband and grandchild. All her life she had saved money for this trip to give thanksgiving to the Miraculous Infant Jesus of Prague.</p> </div>
