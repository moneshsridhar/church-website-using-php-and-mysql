<center><h2> THE HISTORY AND SPIRITUALITY OF INFANT JESUS OF PRAGUE</h2></center><br><br>
<h3 style="color: black; font-weight: bold;">ABOUT THE STATUE SELF</h3>

<p style="color: black;">&nbsp &nbspThe wax figure is 47 cm High. It is protected from damage by a silver casing, that reaches to the waist. The sculpture has probably a wooden core covered with material, that can be seen through the wax. The Infant Jesus was always dressed. It is handed down that Anne Loragh and Mary Sibylla Schayemaier dressed it and then in 1747 the English Ladies. The Infant Jesus wears a white under shirt, over it a white rocheta then a silk top with frills around the neck and hands, the forth and fifth gown is like the priest's pluvial. On his head is placed a crown. The first crown is from the year 1767, the other from 1810 - 20. There have been more than 70 dresses donated. The oldest well-preserved are from 1700. One is donated by the Empress Mary Theresa. The Infant has also new dresses that are made even of white silon. Dresses come as gifts from all the world.</p>

<h3 style="color: black; font-weight: bold;">LEGENDS OF THE INFANT JESUS OF PRAGUE</h3>
<p style="color: black;">&nbsp &nbspThere are also legends narrated of the Infant Jesus of Prague. Can we possibly doubt their truthfulness, as they surely expressed how the people talked, lived and felt about the Infant Jesus?
One of them is about the origin of the Infant . . .
. . . at the time of the battles, to occupy the Pyrenees Penicula, between the Maurs and the Christians there apparently was in the South of Spain a Carmelite Monastery. Even that monastery was invaded. Only four monks rescued their lives. One was called Joseph, who had a special devotion to the Child Jesus. Once as he worked in the yard, suddenly a little child appeared to him and asked to pray with him. Therefore the brother prayed the "AVE" and at the words "blessed is the fruit of your womb Jesus", the child said "that is me". Then the child disappeared, but its face was engraved in his memory. The brother longed immensly to see the child again, even for an instance. He wanted to produce a likeness, that would remind him of the Child Jesus, but his efforts were without success. For many years he struggled but could not make a portrait, until one day the child appeared again. At that time he was already very old. "I came to show my self again to you, so that you could finish the sculpture according to my likeness", said the child. Immediately he started to work. He finished the face like in a dream. He was happy! When he finished the work, the child vanished. The brother was very tired. He fell asleep and never woke up again. His little friend had come to take him home.
As to whether this legend is historically true, I do not know. It sertainly shows however, a lot of feeling, and it is beautiful.
</p>

<p style="color: black;">&nbsp &nbsp Further 3 legendary narratives are caught up in three paintings of a series of pictures of the Gracious Infant, that originated in the first half of the 18th century. They tell of the time, when the sculpture was found with broken arms in the waste in the church behind the High Altar.
Father Cyril was beggining for money to repair the sculpture of the Child Jesus, but without result. By chance a rich man Mr. Benedict Manskonig from Ãšsti, on the river Elbe, came to Prague. He fell seriousely ill and received the Last Rights from Father Cyril, who told him about power that the Child Jesus has. Mr. Benedict then gave 100 golden pieces to the Infant Jesus, to win the favour of the Gracious Child, and he recovered.
Another tale describes, how father Cyril is praying to get money for new arms for the sculpture of the Infant Jesus, when a rich lady comes to visit him, to donate a big amount of money.
A further story tells how the Gracious Child helped the rich family of Henry Kolovrat of Libstejn. His wife lost her hearing and eye-sight. When she was touched with the Infant Jesus, she was restored to health. The lady, however was very selfish. She kept the Miraculous sculpture in her palace as a protection. But when she wanted to leave the palace, the horses would not move. The lady then rearlized that she must return the Infant Jesus to where it belongs. After that they could leave the palace easily.
The miraculous Infant Jesus was greatly worshiped by the mighty and the simple, poor people. Also it is of interest, that the first imitations of the Infant Jesus of Prague were created by the sculptor Jan Schlansovsky in the 18th century. He also carved a mould by which hundreds of copies were made, which were sent throughout the whole world. Also our Misen China factury owns a mould that the sculptor Gottleb Kirchner created according to the famous sculptor J. J. Kandler.
